      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <div>
          <p>UI5con is a welcoming developer community that maintains a friendly and inspiring reputation.
            We’d like to keep it that way, which is why we ask all members, attendees, organizers and sponsors
            to follow this code of conduct (CoC).</p>

          <p>If you have questions regarding this CoC, please contact any of UI5con organisers.</p>

          <h3>Be nice to each other</h3>

          <p>We trust that attendees will treat each other in a way that reflects the widely held view that diversity and
            friendliness are strengths of our community to be celebrated and fostered.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, we believe attendees have a right to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>be treated with courtesy, dignity and respect;</li>
            <li>be free from any form of discrimination, victimization, harassment or bullying;</li>
            <li>enjoy an environment free from unwelcome behavior, inappropriate language and unsuitable imagery.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Be professional and don’t spam</h3>

          <p>Professional events are a great setting to showcase the work of the community and would like to encourage
            networking and business related discussions, as well as keep the conference presentations meaningful and
            interesting for everyone.</p>

          <p>We therefore:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>only allow company marketing or recruiting related activities at the conference in accordance with our sponsor agreements;</li>
            <li>request presentations - outside the official recruiting sessions - to focus on UI5 related topics, not on recruitment.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Organizers will be happy to answer any questions related to marketing or recruiting activities.</p>

          <h3>Solving problems</h3>

          <p>If problems covered by this code of conduct arise, please contact one the organizers directly. Any complaint
            will remain confidential, be taken seriously, investigated, and dealt with appropriately.</p>

          <p>The UI5con organizers reserve the right to carry out any of the following actions relating to a
            complaint:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The person concerned may be told to stop/modify his/her behavior appropriately and a warning will be issued.
            </li>
            <li>
              The person concerned may be warned that enforcement action may be taken if the behavior continues.
            </li>
            <li>
              The person concerned may be asked to leave the venue immediately and/or may be prohibited from continuing to attend the conference (without a refund).
            </li>
            <li>
              The incident may be reported to the local authorities.
            </li>
          </ul>
