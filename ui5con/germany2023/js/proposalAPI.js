      "Service workers are a powerful web technology that allows web applications to work offline and provide better performance. In this session, we will explore how to use service workers to make your UI5 application available offline.\nWe'll cover service worker basics, their capabilities, and how to register and cache essential assets (HTML, CSS, JS, and images) in your UI5 app. Next, we will dive into handling offline requests using the cached assets. We will discuss strategies for handling requests that are not cached, such as fallback mechanisms and offline-first design. We will also cover how to update the cached assets and service worker to ensure that your UI5 application remains up-to-date and reliable. For offline data storage and retrieval, we'll use the browser's local storage IndexedDB and cover how to use it with service workers in this session. Service workers offer offline caching and other background services to enhance UI5 applications, such as background fetch for downloading large files and background sync for data synchronization with a server when the network connection is available. Finally, we will discuss best practices for using service workers in UI5 applications, including performance considerations and security concerns.\nBy the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of how to use service workers to make your UI5 application available offline and provide a seamless user experience, even when there is no internet connection available.\n",

They just run on mobile, desktop AND XR devices – sticking true to UI5s promise to “build once, run everywhere” and still use the additional capabilities and experiences XR provides.\nWe created a modular enhancement of existing UI5 controls, allowing each control to be rendered natively in the XR environment. You can use familiar controls in the XR world without any changes.\nA new way to enable UI5 controls for Mixed Realty has arrived!\n",

Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, adding new features and capabilities that make it one of the most popular languages today. SAPUI5 as a JavaScript-based framework is around since 2013 and if you're familiar with SAPUI5-like JavaScript from its early years (which is still around in many places), you might be surprised at how much the language behind has changed. While some of those features have made it into the SAPUI5 core (there are reasons for the absence of others), only a few are present and used in the otherwise very good official documentation.\nIn this session, we'll take a look at some of the latest features and techniques in modern JavaScript. Next to explaining those features, I will also give some examples taken from the official UI5 documentation and showcase, how the old-school code can be replaced with those modern techniques. Whether you're a seasoned SAPUI5 developer or just getting started, this session might contain some interesting new takes on how to develop modern SAPUI5.",

      "Controls are one of the most important aspects of the UI5 framework. Over time the framework evolved to keep track of new browser versions and web technologies in general. Compared to other frameworks, UI5 is still the first one of its kind which is quite unique these days. The evolution of the UI5 framework has an impact on the rendering of the controls as this is key to the performance of the framework. \n\nUI5 Controls already evolved with the renderer version 2. Now, with WebComponents making its way into the framework, it changes the game again. With a more native web technology the rendering of the controls will take your UI5 app to the next level!\n\nAllow Peter and myself to introduce you into building UI5 controls ready for whatever comes next in the future of the ui5 framework and beyond!\n",

We show how to prepare the application code to be ready for using a configured time zone.\n\nIn a demo we will also show what’s new for the application developers from controls perspective (DatePicker, DateTimePicker, TimePicker, DynamicDateRange, ...) and how to adapt the way of using them to be ready for a configured time zone. We will also show what’s new for the end user, for example using relative timestamps like today or yesterday, or the today/now buttons.",

We then turn to three main use cases for odata2ts within UI5: \n- using typed entity models\n- using the type-safe query builder\n- using the full-fledged client\n\nFinally, we teaser the combination with ui5-mobx, which allows for preserving all type information when it comes down to managing state in UI5.\n",

    description:
      "Reviving work and ideas of early 2017, ui5-mobx brings the power of Mobx (back) into UI5. It provides a special model implementation which takes care of binding (two-way binding is also supported). This MobxModel acts as proxy, so you initialize it once and then never directly interact with it again. And here we get to the gist: With Mobx you control the state yourself. And since you control state directly, you preserve the types which are otherwise lost when using regular models, thus making it a perfect fit for TypeScript.\n\nIn this short presentation we dive into reactive state management with Mobx, see a simple UI5 TypeScript-based app in action using this approach and discuss some patterns to organize your state. We highlight the benefit of derivations / computed values, which allow for complex calculations that are automatically recomputed when your state changes. Finally, we combine Mobx with odata2ts to load state from an OData service.\n",

It includes creating a basic application from the TypeScript template using the \"Easy UI5\" generator, TypeScript coding in regular UI controllers, testing, as well as advanced topics like custom control development and using third-party libraries.\nThe workshop basically follows a newly developed tutorial at GitHub (updated, extended, yet more compact successor of what has been created in 2022 at https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-tutorial/tree/main_2022), with additional background explanations by the authors.\n\nThis is a refreshed reprise of last year's workshop, offered because some things have changed or added and there are for sure plenty of developers who have not embarked on the TypeScript train yet.\n\nPrerequisites to participate in the workshop:\nHave a current version of Node.js (18.x) and npm installed as well as a code editor supporting TypeScript development (preferably the free Microsoft Visual Studio Code, we won't be able to assist in others). TypeScript knowledge is not required, but basic UI5 knowledge will help understand what you are doing.",

      "In real business applications a smart value help for finding the right entries from a list of possible objects is essential for a good user experience. Implementing such value helps that offer a smart selection of objects with filter fields for their properties can be a tedious task, especially if the allowed values are dependent of each other. For example, automatically narrowing down the list of possible cities for an office building search after a country has been chosen. \nThe new MDC (meta data driven) controls of UI5 allow to leverage such smart selections not only for OData but independent of the used protocol by providing the possibility to implement the necessary meta data handling in so called delegates for any kind of information source. The session explains how to create such a smart MDC based value help for a simple JSON model by implementing the value help for an input field to select an office location. \n\nPrerequisites: \nYou'll need node.js (LTS version 18.x) with npm and git and a development environment (like Visual Studio Code) to do the workshop.\n\nWorkshop Materials:\nThe start template and instructions are available at https://github.com/dirkelko/ui5conWorkshop",

Webdiver.io with wdi5 does this for us. Webdriver.io is a testing framework for UI5, it checks expected behaviour of an application by simulating end user business scenarios. Its unaware of the web framework the application uses. wdi5 can fill the gap.\n\nwdi5 come with two benefits, its control locators and synchronization with the web framework. wdi5 exposes  browser.byControl() method that accepts a control locator and returns a proxy for the real control. Then the test can assert control state and even interact with the control. The other benefit is on every element interaction, WDI5 waits for UI5 to completely render and for the application to be completely stable. This is similar to the build-in waiting in WDIO but is much more powerful because of the framework awareness. \n\nIn the hands-on workshop following topic, you can get you hands dirty with\n\n1. Installing wdi5\n2. Setting up configurations\n3. Running your test cases\n\nExited to learn wdi5? let's wdi5!",
