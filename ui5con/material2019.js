This will remove all the logic, related to the model, out of the controller.\n \nNext, I will also explain how the state will put the result of any OData call into different UI5 Objects to achieve separation of concerns.

What are the limitations? What framework to pick - if any? I will answer these questions and in case you need a framework I will show how a third party framework - Vue.js and UI5 Web Components can go hand in hand. Vue.js offers high support for web components, it is also easy to understand and it works both for big or small projects.\n\nBut if you are planning to use UI5 Web Components with Vue.js framework where and how do you start?\nIn this presentation, I will cover how to make the most of the Vue.js environment and tools when using UI5 Web Components in Vue.js, how to set up your environment to get started and how to optimize your build process.
