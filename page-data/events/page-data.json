Nevertheless, there are some things you should know to understand any current and possible future impact.</p>\n<p>The cards topic is actually not new but was already introduced at UI5con@SAP 2019. However, a lot has happened since then and Alexandar summarizes everything for us and demonstrates some of the latest features.</p>\n<p>With UI5 1.81, we introduced the badge control. Diana presents this new control and explains how you can use it.</p>\n<p>No registration needed, just join the webcast at the assigned time.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"UI5con ON AIR","subTitle":"Community conference around the UI5 framework","external":true,"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/74c92b51afb7b760787403fc8b70c0c6/ui5con.svg"},"startDate":"2020/07/09 16:00 UTC+2","endDate":"2020/07/10 13:30 UTC+2","location":"Broadcast","speakers":[],"url":"https://openui5.org/ui5con/onair2020/","recordingUrl":null,"registrationUrl":null},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/travis/build/SAP/openui5-website/data/events/ui5con2020-onair.md","html":""}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The UI5 Tooling — a modern CLI-based development experience!","subTitle":"SAP Community Call (60min)","external":null,"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/c1445845d72deb550c4e0edceba0c08f/sap.svg"},"startDate":"2020/04/01 16:00 UTC+1","endDate":"2020/04/01 17:00 UTC+1","location":"Online","speakers":[{"__typename":"MarkdownRemark","frontmatter":{"name":"Peter Muessig","company":"SAP","twitter":"pmuessig","github":"petermuessig","linkedin":"peter-muessig-7b40576","photo":{"publicURL":"/static/ebf72e7b1d3b7056c53f8346f8a3e3b9/peter-muessig.png"}},"html":""}],"url":null,"recordingUrl":"https://youtu.be/v6ImEbZRRlg?list=PLpQebylHrdh5XQts8bKoMUKexpun_YPvU","registrationUrl":null},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/travis/build/SAP/openui5-website/data/events/sap-community-call-ui5-tooling.md","html":"<p>In this call, you will get an introduction into the possibilities of the UI5 Tooling and how it enhances your local development experience and efficiency.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"UI5con Belgium / Valentine's edition","subTitle":"Community conference around the UI5 framework","external":true,"logo":{"publicURL":"/static/74c92b51afb7b760787403fc8b70c0c6/ui5con.svg"},"startDate":"2020/02/14 09:00 UTC+1","endDate":"2020/02/14 16:30 UTC+1","location":"Belgium","speakers":[],"url":"https://openui5.org/ui5con/belgium2020/","recordingUrl":null,"registrationUrl":null},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/travis/build/SAP/openui5-website/data/events/ui5con2020-belgium.md","html":""}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1547453082","1773185443","2194851699","2194851699","4243531281"]}
