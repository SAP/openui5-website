Our team has also activated branch coverage measurements for the ternary "condition ? then : else" operator. We have now replaced the original BLANKET.JS code Instrumentation by our own and then extended it to include condition coverage as well, because the shortcut evaluation of && and || operators represents just another kind of branching. Later, we instrumented "if" statements in the same fashion, which is particularly interesting in case of missing "else".\n\n\n'},{title:"Get connected with UI5Lab",type:"",speaker:"Emanuele Ricci, Wouter Lemaire, Michael Graf, Margot Wollny",startTime:"16:00",endTime:"18:00",duration:120,abstract:"UI5Lab is a community driven project to establish a repository for UI5 Custom Control Libraries.
