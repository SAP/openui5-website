By developing a similar looking frontend in both frameworks, we had the chance to analyse the development-process and the resulting apps under several aspects.\n\nâ€¢\tDocumentation: How helpful / applicable are the different developer-documentations?\nâ€¢\tScope: How many predefined controls / components are available? Is the scope sufficient for real-world scenarios?\nâ€¢\tNon-control-elements and flexibility: What is needed to build something I cannot represent as a control / component? Which approach provides more possibilities?\nâ€¢\tPerformance: Measured performance using a user-centered approach with Google Lighthouse.\nâ€¢\tAccessibility: Are UI5 Controls and UI5 Web Components both really enterprise ready and equal? Or are there any differences that developers must take into account?\nâ€¢\tOther striking differences we noticed during implementation e.g. different programming models and the need of custom CSS\n \nWe would love to share our experiences with the UI5 community and give further insights into the different scenarios.\n","location":"demo_02","startTime":"10:55","endTime":"11:15","speakers":[{"firstName":"Fabienne","lastName":"Pipping","company":"advades GmbH","bio":"UX Designer and Software Developer, always trying to find the sweet spot between people, technology and business.
