				<h3>Getting There By Public Transport</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>From the North:<br>Take the train to Mannheim Hauptbahnhof (main station). From Mannheim Hauptbahnhof, take the S-Bahn line S3 or S4 towards Bruchsal/Karlsruhe. Get off at the "Rot-Malsch" train station.</li>
					<li>From the South:<br>Take the train to Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof (main station). From Karlsruhe, take the S-Bahn line S3 or S4 towards Mannheim. Get off at the "Rot-Malsch" train station.</li>
				</ul>
