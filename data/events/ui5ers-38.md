In this episode, we will be joined by Christian Voshage to delve into SAPUI5 Flexibility and the "One Service" project. The main goal of this project is to enhance the cloud experience of the SAPUI5 flexibility key user service, making it more streamlined and efficient. 
Christian will emphasize the concept of "build once, run everywhere," addressing the challenges associated with different data storage locations. 
Drawing from his cloud development experiences, he will provide valuabale insights and share his learnings. 

Additionally, Andreas Kunz will introduce the @ui5/dts-generator, a tool that generates TypeScript type definitions for OpenUI5. Recently published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/dts-generator), this tool is now accessible to everyone, enabling them to utilize it for their own OpenUI5 library written in JavaScript. 
Andreas will walk you through the functionality and usage of the dts-generator, demonstrating how it can be employed for any custom OpenUI5 library.
