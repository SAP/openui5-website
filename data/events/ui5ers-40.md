in this episode we will explore the new ui5-table component, an experimental replacement for the previous Table web component found in version 1.x. 
The new Table offers a range of advanced features for efficiently displaying and managing large datasets in a responsive manner. 
Duc Vo Ngoc will showcase the updated API and structure, demonstrate the enhanced capabilities of the new Web Component Table, and provide guidance on how to effectively utilize this component in your projects.

Additionally, we'll highlight improvements in TypeScript support for writing controller extensions. 
Controller extensions enable developers to add functionality to existing applications, facilitating extensibility and reusability. 
Previously, overriding an extension directly in a controller using TypeScript was not possible. 
However, with the latest advancements, we have closed this gap, providing full support for Controller Extensions in TypeScript.
Andreas Kunz will provide a detailed walkthrough of the options and techniques for leveraging controller extensions in your TypeScript projects.
