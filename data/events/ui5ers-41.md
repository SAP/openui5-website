Jan Mummenthaler and Johannes Gluch will kick off the episode by providing an update on the progress made in modularizing the OpenUI5 core and its 
impact on the newly developed bootstrap. Building upon the initial proof of concept presented in episode 29, they will detail how this initiative is 
shaping the upcoming OpenUI5 2.x release. Jan and Johannes will explain how breaking down the monolitic core into distinct modules has enabled more 
flexible bootstrap configuration via a JSON-based approach. Experience the benefits firsthand through live demonstrations showcasing minimal bootstrapping, 
core bootstrap extension, custom configurations, and seamless splash screen integration. Leveraging Google Lighthouse metrics, Jan and Johannes will present 
a directly comparison the bootstrap performance between OpenUI5 1.x and 2.x, highlighting the significant improvements achieved. They will conclude their 
segment by offering a glimpse into the future, discussing how library chunking will further optimize UI5 application loading.

Then we head towards dynamic theming with CSS Custom Properties, fully supported in OpenUI5 since version 1.127. Peter Muessig will take us through the process 
of developing and theming custom UI5 controls using CSS Custom Properties. He will demonstrate how to seamlessly integrate your custom controls with existing 
OpenUI5 themes, enabling effortless switching between them. Furthermore, Peter will introduce the updated Theming Parameter Toolbox, which now includes all 
available CSS Custom Properties, providing developers with a invaluable resource for efficient and effective custom control theming.
