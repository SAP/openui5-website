Welcome to our new webcast series!

In our first episode, we have some experts from our UI5 teams with us. First, Thorsten talks about what had to be done to upgrade UI5 to jQuery 3.5.1. This was not at all an easy thing. We introduced a compatibility layer to ensure that most of the existing application or control code wonâ€™t need any adjustment. Nevertheless, there are some things you should know to understand any current and possible future impact.

The cards topic is actually not new but was already introduced at UI5con@SAP 2019. However, a lot has happened since then and Alexandar summarizes everything for us and demonstrates some of the latest features.

With UI5 1.81, we introduced the badge control. Diana presents this new control and explains how you can use it.
