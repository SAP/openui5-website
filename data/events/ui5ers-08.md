**Caution:** May 13 is a public holiday in Germany, so we had to change our usual schedule. This means that we will meet on the *third* Tuesday in May.

We don't have concrete topics for this episode yet, but we will announce them here soon. So stay tuned!

If you have an idea for a topic, let us know either via [e-mail](mailto:openui5@sap.com?subject=[UI5ers live]) or in the [#UI5ers_live](https://openui5.slack.com/archives/C01CP60AAN7) channel of the [OpenUI5 Slack](https://ui5-slack-invite.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/)!
