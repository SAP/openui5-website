This episode focuses on tools and techniques that can make your OpenUI5 development journey smoother and more efficient.  
Get ready to learn about the new autofix feature in UI5 linter version 1.12.0, a helpful addition that makes it easier to follow 
best practices and move away from outdated OpenUI5 and SAPUI5 APIs. We'll show you how autofix works and how it can help 
refresh your codebase with minimal effort.

We'll also discuss version management for OpenUI5. We'll provide you with information on the endpoints available for retrieving 
version information for OpenUI5 and SAPUI5. Then, we'll showcase three essential tools designed to manage and update 
OpenUI5 and SAPUI5 versions effectively: ui5-task-check-eocp, check-outdated-ui5-version, and UI5 Renovate Preset. 
Through live demonstrations, we'll illustrate the purpose and functionality of each tool, providing additional context to help you 
understand their benefits. We'll conclude with a comparative discussion of these solutions, providing insights to help you determine 
the best approach for your specific projects.
