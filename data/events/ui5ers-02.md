You might have realized that UI5 1.83 has been skipped. Stefan will say a few words about the reasons for this at the beginning of this session.

Afterwards Nikolay, accessibility expert for UI5, gives an overview of what has been done lately to align UI5 with the latest ARIA 1.1 specifications.

We are happy that we can feature a contribution from the community already in this second episode of the webcast and welcome Tobias Hofmann to our round. He will review the contributions to OpenUI5 together with Peter.

To conclude our webcast, we invite all participants to discuss with us topics of interest for the upcoming UI5ers live in December. To collect and rank the topics according to your level of interest, we will use an [idea collection board](https://app.sli.do/event/bw1oo15n/live/ideas). Everyone can access this board and share their opinions.
