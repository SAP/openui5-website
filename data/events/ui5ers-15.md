Also this time we are pleased to have contributions from the UI5 community and you can already look forward to Jakob Kjaer and Marcel Schork, both are so kind to share their current work around UI5 with us. 
Jakob lately created a universal login provider for the UI5 tooling, which becomes especially useful in case authentication is requested in several components. How he came up with this idea and how it all works in details, you will learn firsthand then. Furthermore he is concerned to pick up your [feedback on the current structure of the UI5 ecosystem showcase] (https://github.com/ui5-community/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/issues/562).
Marcel lately focused on the creation of private UI5 templates for specific use cases and thought about configuration options to link private and public UI5 templates. He will present the needs from the customer's point of view, what justifies private templates and how he deals with them in his projects.
Nico Geburek from the SAP Advocates team will also attend the episode and share some latest news around Easy-UI5. And always, you can be curious about news from our UI5 experts.
