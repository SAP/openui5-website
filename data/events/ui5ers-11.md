UI5ers live is back from its summer break and starts with a packed agenda. Many of you may have heard that the SAP Mobile team improved their SAPUI5 barcode scanner control so that it can be used natively in the browser. We have invited James Zhang from SAP Mobile to answer your question on this subject and Marian Zeis from the UI5 community to showcases his PoC that contains the updated control.  
As a further topic, we're going to look at  asychronous loading of XML content. Johannes Gluch from the UI5 Core development team will explain the relevant new factory APIs and showcase how to enable the asychronous loading for XML views or fragments.
