Since the UI5 Journey Recorder was been already prominently featured during SAP TechEd 2022, it is about time to get to know the author of this great testing tool! Stay tuned for Adrian Marten who will take us on a tour with his point-and-click adventure chrome extension for UI5. He will explain to us the benefits of the UI5 Journey Recorder, how fast you can create tests for your UI5 apps even with little to no upfront knowledge and what else can achieve with the UI5 Journey Recorder.
Hanna Olbert will also attend and present the custom task ui5-task-cachebuster she developed recently for the UI5 Ecosystem Showcase.
