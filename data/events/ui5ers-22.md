Since the UI5 Journey Recorder has been already prominently featured during SAP TechEd 2022, itâ€™s about time to get to know the author of this great testing tool! Adrian Marten will take us on a tour with his point-and-click adventure Chrome extension for UI5. He will explain to us the benefits of the UI5 Journey Recorder, how fast you can create tests for your UI5 apps with little to no upfront knowledge, and what else can do with the UI5 Journey Recorder.
Hanna Olbert, our second guest, will present the ui5-task-cachebuster custom task she developed recently for the UI5 Ecosystem Showcase. This task enables cache busting for standalone apps running in the Cloud Foundry environment or on a web server other than the SAP Web Application Server.
