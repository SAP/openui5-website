In this episode we deal with the two following topics: Content Security Policy (CSP) and caching. For this, we have Jens Ittel and Tobias Sorn with us, both colleagues from the UI5 Core development.

CSP compliance is a high-priority topic - not only for us. We already made some good progress here, but still need to remove some obstacles to support strict CSP. Jens will introduce this topic and the current status.

Tobias will be with us to show how the Service Worker API, which is available in modern web browsers, could be used in a UI5 app to realize different caching strategies.

And finally, Peter informs about the progress to retrofit the UI5 Web Components for the UI5 framework.
