In this episode, Merlin will introduce the new UI5 linter, a helpful tool for getting your app ready for UI5 2.x. He'll show us how it works and give us a behind-the-scenes look at how it was built. Merlin will also share the roadmap for the tool, including what features are still planned before the first official release.

Then, Jens will dive into two additions to the UI5 table: the CopyProvider and the CellSelector. These features allow users to easily copy selected rows or individual cells from a table. Jens will demonstrate how to implement and customize these components in your own UI5 application.

If you want to showcase your UI5-related work or have an idea for a topic, let us know either via [e-mail](mailto:openui5@sap.com?subject=UI5ers live) or in the
