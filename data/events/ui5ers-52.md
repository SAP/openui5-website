This episode of UI5ers live explores two recent updates for OpenUI5/SAPUI5 developers. We'll introduce the NotAny and NotAll filter operators in OpenUI5 1.139, explaining the rationale behind their design, illustrating the complex filtering problems they solve, and providing deep dives into their implementation.
Additionally, we'll showcase significant enhancements in the SAP Fiori Tools Adaptation Editor, including streamlined quick actions with real-time UI previews, IntelliSense support for local annotation files, and an improved context menu in the outline pane for easier control selection.

If you want to showcase your UI5-related work or have an idea for a topic, let us know either via [e-mail](mailto:openui5@sap.com?subject=UI5ers live) or in the 
[#UI5ers_live](https://openui5.slack.com/archives/C01CP60AAN7) channel of the [OpenUI5 Slack](https://ui5-slack-invite.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/)!
