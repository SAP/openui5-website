In this presentation Dominik Heim will discuss the benefits of using the preview-middleware to reduce the amount of glue code required to locally run a SAPUI5 app in a 
sandbox launchpad. Additionally, he will explain how this middleware can streamline the process of running QUnit and OPA5 tests, improving efficiency and maintainability.

tl;dr: We're going to delete things.
