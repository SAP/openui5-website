This episode will teach you how to use the UI theme designer to migrate a theme to a new one while also constructing 'Theme Families' (e.g light, dark, high-contrast), 
providing a unified experience. We will illustrate the automated steps in theme migration and also walk you through hands-on theme migration for a more 
comprehensive understanding of the process and its individual parts. We will also discuss potential challenges that might pop up during the migration and offer 
practical troubleshooting tips to ensure a seamless transition.
Walk away with the knowledge and skills needed to confidently migrate your themes and enhance your SAPUI5 applications.

On top of that, we will showcase how the SAP Fiori tools' Project Accelerator uses AI to generate SAPUI5 applications based on business requirements.
By simply inputting an image, watch as the tool autonomously builds an application complete with data models, services, and sample data within a CAP project. 
As we explore this tool's capabilities, we will examine a variety of user input examples, highlighting how this knowledge can be adopted to save time and effort in the 
development of new SAPUI5 applications.
