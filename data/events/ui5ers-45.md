SAP Fiori elements provide a robust toolkit that enables developers to efficiently create SAPUI5 applications. However, many 
hidden features within the SAP Fiori elements toolkit may not always be apparent, making it challenging to align them with specific 
use cases. 
In this episode will explore strategies to analyze web application requirements and identifying the resources and functionalities of 
SAP Fiori elements that can optimize the implementation process. We will delve into resources such as the Flexible Programming Model 
and the SAP Fiori elements Feature Showcase app, guided by insights from the SAP BTP Developer Guide.

Furthermore, we will shift focus to the practical aspects of previewing an application during its development phase using SAP Fiori tools. 
Learn about the latest advancements in local app preview via the VSCode with the SAP Fiori Tools extension, and how the transition 
from local files to virtual routes can reduce maintenance efforts for developers. Additionally, we will introduce the first version 
of a converter designed to help transition existing applications to this new approach.
