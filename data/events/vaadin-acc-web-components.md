Web Components are an excellent basis for building Design Systems, but providing good accessibility can seem like a daunting challenge.

In this webinar, we're joined by engineers and product owners from Adobe, IBM, SAP and ING for a panel discussion on the challenges they've faced, the solutions they've found, and the ways in which they approach these matters in general.

Topics include:
- Screen readers
- Shadow DOM challenges and solutions
- Testing processes
- The upcoming Accessibility Object Model

Host: Rolf Smeds, Vaadin
