In this episode, we will explore two innovative approaches to streamline and enhance the development and testing of SAPUI5/OpenUI5 applications.
First, Martin Häuser will introduce Joule, SAP's AI assistant, and demonstrate its capabilities in supporting SAPUI5 code writing. He will showcase Joule's available commands, discuss the concepts and ideas behind it, and how it can be leveraged to implement app features efficiently. Additionally, Martin will demonstrate Joule's latest SAPUI5 capability: AI-driven migration of existing SAPUI5 applications to TypeScript, simplifying the transition process for developers.

Following this, Matthias Oßwald and Florian Vogt will present the Test Starter, a concept designed to streamline the test setup for OpenUI5 applications and libraries. The Test Starter orchestrates QUnit and OPA5 tests, reducing the boilerplate code required for writing QUnit tests and ensuring the loading of commonly used testing frameworks. By loading these frameworks and test modules asynchronously and complying with the Content Security Policy, the Test Starter enables a more efficient and secure testing process. Matthias and Florian will demonstrate the ease of enabling a project using the Test Starter and highlight the significant benefits this new approach brings to test setup and configuration.
