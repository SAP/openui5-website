We're rested and refreshed and ready for another chat with you! As always, we will start with latest news from the UI5 labs led by Stefan. One of the topics will be the discontinuation of support for IE11 starting with UI5 1.88.

For our discussion on performance, we invited Kristian Kraljic, Technical Lead Architect of SAP for Me and the SAP ONE Support launchpad, to join our webcast. He will share with us how his team optimized the bootstrap flow to boost the performance of their UI5 app.

Then we will take a closer look at the recently published full-stack sample app showcasing CAP, OData V4, and draft mode. Peter and Andreas, who were involved in this project, will guide us through the app and explain some basics, methods and tricks.
