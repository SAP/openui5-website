In this episode, we focus once again on tables. In addition to Sebastian Bender, we will have Jay Barbhaiya from the UI5 Tables team with us. Jay will show the new Column Resizer plug-in plus the auto pop-in feature for responsive tables. After that, thereâ€™s plenty of time for your questions. We will also address the remaining open questions about tables from last time. We hope you tune in!
