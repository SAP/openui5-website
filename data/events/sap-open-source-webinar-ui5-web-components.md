Join us for a webinar about the latest UI Open Source offering by SAP: UI5 Web Components. In this session, you will explore the UI5 Web Components, which are lightweight and easy to consume UI building blocks that allow you to build enterprise ready UIs with any technology of choice. They are also a carrier of Fiori design paradigm.
