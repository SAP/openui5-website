This episode will cover two key aspects of OpenUI5 development: the manifest.json file and accessibility. First, we will explore the crucial role of the manifest.json file as the central configuration point for OpenUI5 applications. We'll explore version dependencies, common pitfalls encountered when schema versions and runtime versions are mismatched, and best practices for maintaining a healthy manifest file.  Real-world examples will illustrate these challenges and demonstrate solutions to ensure compatibility and avoid unexpected issues. 

The second part will focus on recent accessibility advancements in OpenUI5 and UI5 Web Components. We will examine how WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) principles influence development and showcase practical demos highlighting accessibility features in various controls. We'll also discuss our ongoing efforts to align with ARIA 1.2 standards, leveraging its new features and ensuring our code remains up-to-date with best practices. Finally, we'll provide insights into our screen reader testing environment, including the switch to JAWS 2024, and clarify the supported accessibility standards within the framework.
