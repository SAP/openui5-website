In this episode, everything revolves around custom libraries. We have therefore invited Volker Buzek and Marco Beier from the community to our talk. Together with Peter and Matthias Osswald they started a project aimed at providing a general concept how custom libraries can be reused in UI5 projects. It also addresses how to create libraries so they can be published and finally consumed (as nmp dependencies).

As always, there are also news from the UI5 labs led by Stefan. One of the topics to be covered is the planned removal of outdated UI5 resources from the CDN in Q3/2021.
