We start this episode with Merlin Beutlberger and Matthias Osswald, who will introduce you to the upcoming UI5 Tooling version 3 and explain some of their ideas for the next major enhancements. Adding to this topic, Christian Pfisterer will show a productive OpenUI5 application used at Home Shopping Europe to demonstrate the magic of the UI5 Tooling when it’s used to develop an UI5 application with TypeScript as well as third-party npm packages and the OpenUI5 CDN.
Lastly, there is something new from the OData V4 model: Uwe Reeder will showcase how to defer the deletion of an entity via an API group using the OData V4 model. This new feature enables a non-draft application to postpone the deletion until the user presses the Save button, just like it’s done with property changes. The deletion can also be canceled again.
