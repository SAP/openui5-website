We start this episode with Merlin Beutlberger and Matthias Osswald, who will give an introduction of the upcoming UI5 Tooling version 3 and explain some of thier ideas for the next major enhancements. Along the same side, Christian Pfisterer will demonstrate on a productive OpenUI5 application used at Home Shopping Europe the tricks of the UI5 Tooling when developing an UI5 application with TypeScript, third-party npm packages and the OpenUI5 CDN.
Lastly, there is something new from the OData V5 model: Uwe Reeder will showcase how to defer the deletion of an entity via an API gorup using the OData V4 model. This new feature enables a non-draft application to postpone the deletion until the user presses the Save button, just like itâ€™s done with property changes. The deletion can also be canceled again.
