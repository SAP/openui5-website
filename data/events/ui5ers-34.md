Join us us for the upcoming UI5ers live event and explore the latest advancements in the UI5 ecosystem. 

First up, we have Volker Buzek, who will showcase his contributions to the Easy-UI5 application templates. These templates now boast built-in wdi5 support, offering you a frictionless integration experience. Volker will guide you through the steps, illustrating how this fusion can supercharge your workflow and streamline your development process.

Next up is Peter Muessig, spotlighting a new feature of Easy UI5 – nesting generators. This powerful capability allows you to combine and leverage different generators with ease, amplifying their functionalities. Easy-UI5 handles all the download, installation, and execution tasks, simplifying your development experience and giving you more flexibility. 

But there is more! Peter will also unveil a fresh addition to the UI5 core – the Web Components base class. This class lays the foundation for seamlessly embedding Web Components into the data binding and rendering lifecycle of UI5. Now, you can smoothly incorporate any Web Component of your choice into UI5, elevating them first-class citizens within the framework.

So, get ready for an enlightening deep-dive into the dynamic world of UI5. We'll see you there!
