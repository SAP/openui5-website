Want to streamline data exports and eliminate binding path errors in your applications? This episode is for you! 
First, learn how to implement performant data export to 
formats such as Excel using the `sap.ui.export.Spreadsheet control`. We will demonstrate implementation strategies for handling large datasets, error management, and flexible 
data provisioning (OData, table binding) using a real-world customer scenario, including the powerful filtering capabilities of the Export Handler.

Second, get an exclusive look at the new, experimental TypedJSONModel. As a type-safe alternative to the classic JSONModel, it enables compile-time checks, automatic type inference, and seamless auto-completion in VS Code. We'll show you in a live demo with code examples how you can boost your productivity and build more robust applications.
