Want to streamline data exports and eliminate binding path errors in your SAPUI5 applications? This episode is for you! First, learn how to implement performant data export to 
formats such as Excel using the `sap.ui.export.Spreadsheet control`. We will demonstrate implementation strategies for handling large datasets, error management, and flexible 
data provisioning (OData, table binding) using a real-world customer scenario, including the powerful filtering capabilities of the Export Handler.

Second, we address the reliability of binding paths. We will discuss the results of a survey on this topic and the implementation of types for the OpenUI5 JSON model and its methods. 
This enhanced TypeScript support enables more reliable and maintainable applications. This discussion is based on a recent bachelor's thesis project, supported by us, which 
investigated the challenges of error-prone binding paths and the benefits of strict typing in OpenUI5.

If you want to showcase your UI5-related work or have an idea for a topic, let us know either via [e-mail](mailto:openui5@sap.com?subject=UI5ers live) or in the 
[#UI5ers_live](https://openui5.slack.com/archives/C01CP60AAN7) channel of the [OpenUI5 Slack](https://ui5-slack-invite.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/)!
