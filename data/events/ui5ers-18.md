In this month we welcome back Marian Zeis to our round of panelists. Marian worked over the last weeks on on a web page to show the best UI5 community projects, be it applications, libraries, custom controls, tooling extensions, middlewares, tasks or Easy-UI5 generators. We want to talk to him about how he came up with this idea, the purpose of the page, and what the next goals are. And for sure we will also discuss with him the specific features and how they are implemented. Furthermore you can be curious about further news from the prdouction of UI5.
