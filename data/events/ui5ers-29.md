The agenda is not finalized yet, but we have some good ideas already up our sleeves and will publish them here once confirmed but latest the week before. 
What we can say already now is that we will take up some topics from this year's UI5con keynote and explore them in depth. 

If you want to showcase your UI5-related work or have an idea for a topic, let us know either via [e-mail](mailto:openui5@sap.com?subject=UI5ers live) or in the 
[#UI5ers_live](https://openui5.slack.com/archives/C01CP60AAN7) channel of the [OpenUI5 Slack](https://ui5-slack-invite.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/)!
