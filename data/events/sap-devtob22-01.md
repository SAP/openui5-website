The authors of the book Clean SAPUI5 are going to talk about how to make SAPUI5 / Javascript code more readable, maintainable and testable.

The book is written with the intention to help developers utilize the concept of clean code in their SAPUI5 projects. (It’s similar to Clean ABAP, in its concept.) The authors are excited to bring the same principles to those working with SAPUI5 and JavaScript! The book is designed to describe the rules, practices, principles, patterns, guidelines, and recommendations for how to make your SAPUI5/JavaScript code clean — that is, readable, understandable, maintainable, and testable.
