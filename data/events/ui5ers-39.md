The UI5 tooling is the development and build tooling of UI5. It is built in a modular and extensible way so that it can be easily extended by your needs. 
In this episode Peter Muessig will showcase various tooling extensions which can boost your development experience by far so that you can really work offline, 
transpile your code in your project to use even newer versions of EcmaScript (than 2022 which is supported right now by the UI5 tooling), 
consume any npm package of your choice in your project, using different kind of proxies, and even stitching UI5 projects during development together 
to mimic your target environment.

If you want to showcase your UI5-related work or have an idea for a topic, let us know either via [e-mail](mailto:openui5@sap.com?subject=UI5ers live) or in the 
[#UI5ers_live](https://openui5.slack.com/archives/C01CP60AAN7) channel of the [OpenUI5 Slack](https://ui5-slack-invite.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/)!
