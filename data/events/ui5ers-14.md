UI5ers live is back on the scene to keep you updated on current projects in and around UI5. This time we start with Stefan Beck, who will give you an insight into the major milestones for UI5 he has set for 2022.
Next up, weâ€™re really happy to have a contribution from the community again. Wouter Lemaire has dealt a lot with TypeScript in UI5 lately and has used it for several projects already. This gave him the idea to create a flexible column layout template to kick-start UI5 projects with TypeScript. In this episode, he will showcase this template to you. 
In addition, Peter Muessig and Andreas Kunz will talk about a tutorial for TypeScript in UI5 that they created.
