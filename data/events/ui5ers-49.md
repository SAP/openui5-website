Join us for an exciting UI5ers live session where we explore how to bring AI capabilities to your OpenUI5 applications using LM Studio and UI5 Web Components for AI.
We’ll show how LM Studio makes it easy to run large language models locally and how its TypeScript client can be seamlessly integrated into OpenUI5 apps. 
You'll also see how to build intelligent features using the AI UI components from UI5 Web Components – all powered by a locally running LLM.
This session is perfect for developers looking to get hands-on with AI in OpenUI5, experiment with local LLMs, and discover how to build smarter, more responsive applications.

If you want to showcase your UI5-related work or have an idea for a topic, let us know either via [e-mail](mailto:openui5@sap.com?subject=UI5ers live) or in the 
[#UI5ers_live](https://openui5.slack.com/archives/C01CP60AAN7) channel of the [OpenUI5 Slack](https://ui5-slack-invite.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/)!
