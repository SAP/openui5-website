In this episode, we will explore the new opportunity to create adaptation projects not only in SAP Business Application Studio (BAS), 
but also in the popular Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor, using the SAP Fiori tools extension. 
This version is currently in an experimental stage and is being released to gather early feedback from our developer community.
During the session, we will demonstrate the functionality of this VSCode extension, discuss its current limitations, and eagerly await your valuable feedback.

Furthermore, we will delve into the successful release of adaptation projects for S/4HANA Cloud in BAS. 
This launch enables developers to enhance SAPUI5 applications in Cloud ERP with comprehensive features that were previously exclusive to on-premise customers.
We will highlight the unique aspects of this offering and discuss key points to consider.
