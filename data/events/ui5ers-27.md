Let's continue our discussion about TypeScript, this time with focus on UI5. Andreas and Peter had been quite busy the last months and made enormous progress implementing TypeScript support in UI5 they want to share with you.
In addition, we invited Mike Zaschka to talk about his [ChatGPT-like chat UI5](https://github.com/p36-io/cap-ui5-gpt-chat) app and discuss the findings he gained from complex UI5 projects with regard to project structure, utility functions, event handlers, and more.

If you want to showcase your UI5-related work or have an idea for a topic, let us know either via [e-mail](mailto:openui5@sap.com?subject=UI5ers live) or in the 
[#UI5ers_live](https://openui5.slack.com/archives/C01CP60AAN7) channel of the [OpenUI5 Slack](https://ui5-slack-invite.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/)!
