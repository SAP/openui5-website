In this episode, you’ll learn how to set up Jest with TypeScript for your OpenUI5 applications. 
See how to configure the testing environment, write meaningful unit tests, and use mocking techniques that fit your 
workflow.

You’ll also get hands-on with a new SAPUI5 Flexibility feature.
Now, as a Key User, you can change properties directly at the OData Model level and immediately update all controls 
that use those properties. The feature currently supports use cases like renaming and text arrangement. 
Finally, let's discuss the future of this technology; share your ideas for future development and potential use cases.

If you want to showcase your UI5-related work or have an idea for a topic, let us know either via [e-mail](mailto:openui5@sap.com?subject=UI5ers live) or in the 
[#UI5ers_live](https://openui5.slack.com/archives/C01CP60AAN7) channel of the [OpenUI5 Slack](https://ui5-slack-invite.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/)!
