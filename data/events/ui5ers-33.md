Join us in celebrating a decade of open sourcing the UI5 Framework as OpenUI5! The UI5 team is thrilled to invite the entire UI5 community to a special session commemorating this remarkable milestone. We have planned an unforgettable event filled with gratitude, reflection, and excitement for what lies ahead.

Mark your calendars and prepare to be part of this momentous occasion. Together, let's honor the past, acknowledge the present, and shape the future of OpenUI5.

If you want to showcase your UI5-related work or have an idea for a topic, let us know either via [e-mail](mailto:openui5@sap.com?subject=UI5ers live) or in the
