Join us for an enlightening session where our experts Pieter Janssens and Daniel Nanovski share their experiences and solutions with you. First, Pieter will discuss the challenges he faced while using UAA in combination with ui5-middleware-cfdestination, and how he collaborated with Peter to overcome these obstacles. He will also delve into the issues he encountered with TypeScript transpiling UI5. Pieter will share his journey of reaching out to the UI5 team and the solution they developed together. To make the session even more engaging, Pieter will demonstrate the solution to you, providing a hands-on experience.

Next, Daniel will shift focus to enhancing user experience by explaining the intricate technicalities involved in displaying comprehensible descriptions for IDs using SAPUI5 Smart Controls. In the world of business applications, cryptic IDs are ubiquitous. However, these can be confounding for everyday users. Daniel will explain how SAPUI5 Smart controls can be leveraged to address this challenge. He will guide you on utilizing proper annotations or control APIs to achieve the desired state, whether it's displaying both the description and ID side by side, showing only the description, or dealing with more technical scenarios where only the IDs are required.

Don't miss this opportunity to gain valuable insights and practical knowledge from these experts in the UI5 community and UI5 Team. Join us for an informative and interactive session that will enhance your UI5 development skills and empower you to tackle these important challenges.
