For this episode we get some reinforcement by Tobias Queck from the SAP UX Engeneering team and Volker Buzek, SAP Mentor and UI5 enthusiast from the beginning. The two got together to drive forward open sourcing major parts of the SAP Fiori Tools, namely in this manner they are compatible with the UI5 Community tools. The main focus for the initial release of the Open UX Tools, as the open source alternative is called, was to extract the SAP Fiori freestyle templates from the SAP Fiori application generator and provide them as a reusable writer modules for the SAP Fiori application generator and the community-driven Easy-UI5 generator. How this collaboration came about, how the writer module can be used in Easy-UI5 and what is in the pipeline for the Open UX Tools, this and much more Tobias and Volker are prepared to talk about.
A further topic is the progress with TypeScript in UI5. Andreas Kunz has been quite busy the last weeks and created a central entry point for TypeScript in UI5 with the collected documenations, best practices and examples. In addition he will showcase how you can develop a custom control using TypeScript.
