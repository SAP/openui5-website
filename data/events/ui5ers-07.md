In this episode, we're joined by Marius Obert, owner of the [Easy-UI5 Generator](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/02/05/introducing-the-easy-ui5-generator/), and Geert-Jan Klaps, who recently published the [UI5 Library Generator](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/24/kickstart-your-ui5-library-development-with-the-ui5-library-generator/). We talk about the idea to open the easy-ui5 generator to the community and enable everyone to easily create their own plug-in for the generator. Thus, their use in projects becomes a no brainer.
In the second part of our webcast, Andreas talks about the progress of TypeScript support in UI5 app development. Of course, there will also be the usual update on what the UI5 teams are up to right now.
