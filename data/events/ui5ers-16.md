Also in March we’ll gather for UI5ers live again. There are some excellent news for us to spread, so you shouldn’t miss that one!
As always, we have invited some additional panelists to our round. You can look forward to interesting discussions with Volker Buzek, co-author of [wdi5](https://js-soft.github.io/wdi5/#/), and Tobias Sorn, from the UI5 development team.
Now that it was officially announced that wdi5 becomes the legitimate successor of UIVeri5, we want to talk with Volker about what is currently happening in the project and the roadmap planning for wdi5. And for sure there will be enough time to answer any question you might have about this. 
Tobias is in charge of two new features or rather changes in the UI5 framework, which were recently delivered. The first one concerns the parsing of numbers and its change to strict parsing. Tobias will tell you what this means and how this affects your UI5 app. As his second topic, Tobias will introduce the new timezone configuration for timestamps. As always, we are looking forward to a lively exchange with you and our community!
